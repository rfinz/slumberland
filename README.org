* Slumberland

Slumberland is an AI dream from a different computer universe. It is
AI that is humane in both scale and ambition.

** "Artificial" Intelligence should be a little bit dumb!

There is no need to memorize the entirety of human thought in order to
accomplish simple tasks. Slumberland is the fantasy world in which AI
can make progress without first encoding the universe.

Slumberland is built on Rust, naivety, and the belief that clear
thought creates more value than floating point operations.
